After much time thinking about writing a blog, finally it's alive! As it's my personal blog I will write about stuff that interests me :) Concretely I want to write about coding, problems that I find, tips and the big amount of stuff that I would learn.

My main development stack is PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, LESSâ€¦ but I love to try new languages, tools, ways to solve problems, etc.

This is because I built the blog with [Octopress](http://octopress.org). I based my theme in the classic theme and used [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) as a bootstrap. I called [Octozurb](https://github.com/pedronofuentes/octozurb) (I know, it isn't quite original) and if you want fork it, but please, let me learn from your improvements.
